			<h2>About me</h2>

			<p>I've been building websites for just over 10 years; starting when I was just 13. Back then I built small brochure sites for friends and family whenever I could; desperate to get my hands on anything to do with the web.</p>

			<p>For the past 6 years I have lead the front-end team at <a target="_blank" href="http://blubolt.com" title="External link to blubolt">blubolt</a> - a leading eCommerce agency. Whilst at blubolt, I have spent my time advocating the importance of design and great user experiences across the teams - on both our <a href="http://blubolt.com/customers" title="External link to blubolt clients" target="_blank">client sites</a> and our internal tooling/<a href="http://blubolt.com/blucommerce" title="External link to bluCommerce" target="_blank">platform</a>.</p>

			<p>Starting in September 2017 I joined the team at <a href="https://deepbluesky.com" title="External link to Deep Blue Sky" target="_blank">Deep Blue Sky</a>; a leading software development studio. If you would like to work on something interesting together; I am available for a <strong>limited amount</strong> of freelance work <span id="currentMonth">next month</span>.</p>
