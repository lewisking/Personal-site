			<h2>About me</h2>

			<p>I've been a working with the web for over 12 years, starting all the way back when I was just 13. I love creating clean, modern & usable sites and online experiences.</p>

			<p>For 6 years I headed up the front-end team at <a target="_blank" href="http://blubolt.com" title="External link to blubolt">blubolt</a> - a leading eCommerce agency. Whilst at blubolt, I spent my time building front-end features and functionality to help fuel growth, and improve all aspects of our integration process. I was hands-on with clients and a public facing member of the production team. I built most of the front-end on our <a href="/projects/ecommerce" title="Building the front-end for some of the UK's biggest eCommerce retailers">client sites</a> and our internal tooling/<a href="projects/cmseditor/" title="Providing UX consultation and front-end build on a new in-line CMS editor for eCommerce sites">platform features</a>.</p>

			<p>Last year I joined the team at <a href="https://deepbluesky.com" title="External link to Deep Blue Sky" target="_blank">Deep Blue Sky</a>; a leading software development studio. Whilst at Deep Blue Sky I have built the front-end for varying projects including <a href="/projects/ssgreatbritain" title="Read about an interactive app for SS Great Britain">an interactive museum kiosk</a>, a medical recruitment platform and a browser plugin to help you manage your news bias.</p>

			<p>As of September 2019, I'm travelling through Asia whilst working with the <a href="https://poolside.fm" target="_blank" title="Open poolside.fm in a new window">poolside.fm</a> team, where I lead development.</p>
