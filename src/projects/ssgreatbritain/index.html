			<h2>An Introduction</h2>

			<p>For one of my first projects at <a target="_blank" title="Deep Blue Sky's website" href="http://deepbluesky.com">Deep Blue Sky</a>; I was tasked with creating the front-end for an easy to use, interactive tablet experience for both online and in-museum kiosks. The project was many months of work. XXX</p>

			<h2>Technicals</h2>
			<p>The app was built using Vue.js, with all data coming from a custom API that our back-end team built. The CMS is Spirit, our in-house platform. The front-end is fully responsive and uses Google Maps for the maps functionality.</p>

			<h2>Impact</h2>
			<p>The app has had a big impact on-board the ship, launching to much praise from voluenteers and staff, as well as visitors to the museum. I hope to take what we have and improve on it with new features, whilst hopefully re-writing a few areas that I found difficult to build, now that my knowledge of Vue has increased.</p>
