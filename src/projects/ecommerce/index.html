			<h2>An Introduction</h2>

			<p>Whilst at blubolt I built the front-end for some of the UK's biggest eCommerce retailers. When I started at the company I was the only front-end developer by title so coded absolutely every site that left our doors! However, after a few years, I started to hire for, and managed the front-end team. This roll shift meant I oversaw smaller eCommerce builds, whilst still getting my hands dirty and coding the front-end for our bigger clients, but had more time to spend on internal projects and tooling. At at my time of leaving the company the front-end team was 6 people, all whom I am immensely proud of and will miss dearly.</p>

			<p>The best way to see this work for yourself is to check out the live sites. The following work I either lead the front-end team and built the majority of the front-end, or I built the entire front-end myself. Generally these projects lasted 3-4 months each.</p>
