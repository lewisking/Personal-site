			<h2>An Introduction</h2>

			<p>Whilst at blubolt I built the front-end for some of the UK's biggest eCommerce retailers. When I started at the company I was the only front-end developer by title, so built absolutely every site that left our doors! However, after a few years I started to hire into and manage a small front-end team. This roll shift meant I oversaw smaller eCommerce builds, whilst still getting my hands dirty and coding the front-end for our bigger clients. It also meant I had more time to spend on <a href="@@webRoot/projects/bluprint" title="Read about bluprint, a live style guide &amp; CSS library I created">internal projects</a> and tooling. At at my time of leaving the company the front-end team was 6 people, I am immensely proud of what we achieved and will miss them all dearly.</p>

			<p>The best way to see my work is to check out the live sites yourself! Below are some links to projects I have built the entire front-end on:</p>
