# My Personal Portfolio
> This is my personal portfolio. Not much else to say on that!

## Installation
1. Run "npm install" to bring down all dependencies. 
2. Run "brew install imagemagick" & "brew install graphicsmagick" to install image compressors.
3. Run "gulp" to kick off BrowserSync, Sass & creation of the dist folder.
4. Run "gulp --production" to build a production ready dist folder where all images are compressed, JS & CSS are minified, Autoprefixer and UnCSS are run.
6. Run "gulp deploy" to push the dist folder to gh-pages branch and to remove redundant partial files that get compiled.
