# My Personal Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio. Not much else to say on that!

## Installation
1. Run "npm install"
2. Run "grunt" to kick off a little server and live reload 
4. Run "grunt compress" to make sure all images are compressed. This is seperate to build process as over time this will compress images too far.
5. Before deploying, run "grunt build" to compress JS & CSS, run Autoprefixer and UnCSS.
